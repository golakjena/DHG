					<p>Developing a hotel is both an art and a science. At DHG, we strive to master the science of hotel development, while differentiating ourselves from every other development company through the application of artistic and creative skills.</p>
					<p>Each of our hotels is custom-designed to represent its distinct market and culture. Given the changing dynamics of the hospitality industry, choosing the right product for the right market can be a challenging task. Understanding the science side of the industry allows us to develop high quality assets with premium brand affiliations in strategic markets. Applying the art side of the industry allows us to create hotels that are uniquely tailored to those markets and clients. Aside from normal due diligence of market analysis and feasibility studies, each project is carefully analyzed and reviewed through a disciplined process to assure the highest probability of success.</p>
					<p>We are proud to say that DHG currently turns down more projects than we develop. We are highly selective with our projects, as well as our strategic partners. We want to make sure that we have the right partnerships to promote healthy returns and growth for all our stakeholders. Our objective is more than just developing hotels; it is producing excellence in the quality, design, and people involved in each and every one of our projects.</p>

					<p>At DHG, perfection is our passion. We believe our team should not only meet, but exceed industry standards in every aspect of hotel management. From guest satisfaction to employee performance, our goal is to implement a system that will produce loyal and long-term relationships.</p>
					<p>The members of our group must share our passion for the hotel industry, which is why we seek the best operators in each region. We engage driven and innovative property managers to operate the individual hotels, who will assist the corporate team and help further our goals.</p>
					<p>Most importantly, our progressive hotel management style requires a creative influence. We listen to, support, and encourage different approaches as we continually strive to improve. Our team is continuously looking for ways to increase efficiency without sacrificing the quality of our services. The hospitality environment is frequently changing; therefore, we ensure that each member of our group is thoroughly educated and informed about the latest developments and trends in the industry. We realize that we must continuously improve to achieve perfection. After all, “to improve is to change, and to be perfect is to change often.” - Winston Churchill</p>
